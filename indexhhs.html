        <h4>About HHS</h4>
        <p> Due to the CoronaVirus pandemic, many people have been visiting all these information health and human service websites in a panic looking to find more information about this virus which took over the world rapidly. The site traffic for this website
            increased significantly, and with it so did the need to make it operate better. My ambitious partner and I decided to re-design the website, focusing mostly on the navigational aspects, and added some changes to the color palette as well.
            <br><br> The mission of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans, by providing for effective health and human services and by fostering sound, sustained advances in the
            sciences underlying medicine, public health, and social services.
            <ul>
                <li>This website was incredibly unorganized and the overall design patterns remained inconsistent, to say the least.</li>
                <li>We focused mostly on the navigation aspect of the website to make it easier to navigate it</li>
                <li> In order to make the website easier to navigate via laptop and mobile phone my partner Maya Kumaran and I decided to re-design a responsive web design for this website.</li>
            </ul>
